        <h2>Data Export Plugin</h2>
        <p>
        This plugin exports selected file categories of the Run to the designated directory.  It can be used to set up an automated data backup mechanism.
        In effect, this plugin is an automated Manual Data Management Export action.
        These are the File Categories to export.  Selecting all four will copy all files generated for an experiment.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Signal Processing Input
            <li>Basecalling Input
            <li>Output Files
            <li>Intermediate Files
        </ul>
        <p>
        An example of how to use it would be to have a network storage device mounted on the local filesystem.  The mountpoint directory would be entered into
        the Upload Path field.  Select one or more file categories.  Set the plugin to autorun.  When a run completes analysis, all selected files will be
        copied to the [Upload Path]/exportedReports directory.  (Raw data will be copied to a separate directory [Upload Path]/[run directory])
        </p>
        <p>
        The action will be logged in the Data Management log for the given run.  A message banner will also be generated on the website, just as it is when a
        manual Data Management action is initiated.
        </p>
